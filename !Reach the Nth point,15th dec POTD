There are N points on the road, you can step ahead by 1 or 2 . If you start from a point 0, and can only move from point i to point i+1 after taking a step of length one, find the number of ways you can reach at point N. 
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function nthPoint() which takes N as input parameter and returns the total number of ways modulo 109 + 7 to reach at Nth point.
CODE:
class Solution{
	public:
		int nthPoint(int n){
		    // Code here
		    int a=1;
		    int b=2;
		    int mod=1000000007;
		    if(n<3) return n;
		    for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
		        int temp=a;
		        a=b%mod;
		        b=(temp+a)%mod;
		    }
            return b;
		}
};
